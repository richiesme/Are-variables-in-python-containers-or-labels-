    "#### In the previous section of this series, we looked at the puzzling behaviour of python variables vis a vis it's mutability/ immutability and we were able to establish that immutable objects such as int, floats, strings, and tuples do not by python design allow you to change it's value and an attempt to change the value of one variable that is set to be same to another would only create a different object and does not affect the other variable. \n",
    "#### However, this is not so for mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries. Because, when you change an element within a list or dictionary that is set to be same as another, the value of the object changes and is effected within the other variable. \n",
    "#### In this section we are going to look at why this is so. But firstly, I would like for us to know that in python, everything is treated as an object. And every object has three attributes namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  _**Type - This is the kind of object created, e.g int, string etc.**_\n",
    "   -  _**Identity - This refers to the location or address that the object is located within the computter memory**_\n",
    "   -  _**Value - This is the value stored by the object within the computer's memory, e.g x = 3 would mean an int holds the value 3.**_\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Also, while ID and Type cannot be changed once created, values can be changed for Mutable objects.\n",
    "#### So, let's take advantage of the ID attribute using id() function on the examples from our previous section to see the numerical representation of the memory location of an object to show you what happens when the value of an object is changed. \n",
    "#### Note that when declaring a variable in C, you have to declare it's type unlike in python where variables are created automatically when they're first assigned and does not require an end-of-line delimeter as shown below; "
